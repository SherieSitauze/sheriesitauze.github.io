<p>You are one of the three fire signs: you identify either as <strong>Aries</strong>, <strong>Leo</strong>, or <strong>Sagittarius</strong>. Fire signs are known for their passion, creativity, spontaneity, inspiration, and competitive spirit. “Overall, [you] desperately need to be inspired to be happy,” says Donna Page, a professional astrologer with a graduate degree in counselling psychology. “Think of the element of fire—it needs fuel. Otherwise, the fire dies down.” Page says that fire signs can get “grumpy in their own way” when you don’t feel motivated to do something, which is why it’s so important for people who belong to these signs to mix things up regularly. But there’s so much more to it than that.</p>
