<p>You are one of the three earth signs: you identity either as <strong>Taurus</strong>,<strong>Virgo</strong> or <strong>Capricorn</strong>. Earth signs are considered the most grounded of the zodiac. Earth is the element that teaches one the wisdom of making the hard choices that bring long-term and lasting rewards," says Linda Joyce, a professional astrologer and author of The Star Within: Tapping the Power of The Zodiac. As a result, earth signs embrace hard work, commitment, and truth. You take pride in your self-discipline and your reliable reputations, according to Joyce. All three earth signs are practical and methodical. You are considered the "builders of the universe" because structure is of personal importance. But while you love a plan of action, you’re not a mega-serious stick in the mud, you just appreciate stability.</p>
