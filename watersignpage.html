    <p>You are one of the three water signs: <strong>Cancer</strong>, <strong> Scorpio</strong>, or <strong>Pisces</strong>. You don’t shy away from deep and heavy conversations and can typically suss out what someone’s got going on beneath the surface, according to Narayana Montúfar, a senior astrologer at Astrology.com. “[You] see right through people and know their real intentions. Signs of this element are also very prone to be in relationships, as [your] need to merge with another means [you] function better when [you] feel safe and protected,” she explains. “Plus, the sensitivity that comes from the water element also translates into great creativity.”</p>
