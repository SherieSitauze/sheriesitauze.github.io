<p>You are one of the three air signs: you identify either as <strong>Aquarius</strong>, <strong>Gemini</strong> or <strong>Libra</strong>. “[You are] all about intellectual and mental energy, and everything that has to do with communication,” says Narayana Montúfar, senior astrologer at Astrology.com. “[You] spend a lot of time up in [your] head—thinking and analysing every side of a situation.” It’s not surprising that air signs are often considered the smartest signs of the zodiac and, consequently, get bored easily. “If something isn’t meeting [your] needs, [you] are quick to make changes,” says astrologer Sanasjia Clervoix.</p>
